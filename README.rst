Synopsis
--------

`basename.sql` contains functions which provide the POSIX-equivalent
functions `basename` and `dirname` of PostgreSQL.  The functions are
written in fairly standard PL/pgSQL, and should work with any version of
PostgreSQL after version 6.

I make no claim that these functions are SQL/PSM-compliant.
